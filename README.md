# Arrays

## Learning Goals

-   Practice writing arrays
-   Practice manipulating arrays

## Introduction

We've seen how arrays can be created and manipulated. Now we can practice
putting it all together. To recap, `push()` _pushes_ elements onto the _ends_ of
arrays, and `pop()` _pops_ them off; similarly, `unshift()` _adds_ elements to
the _beginnings_ of arrays, and `shift()` _pulls_ them off. Now it's time to
practice what we've learned.

## Practice Writing Arrays

We're going to work with actions that _mutate_ ("change") their underlying
structures (like `pop()`, `push()`, `shift()`, and `unshift()`).

Generally, it's good practice to avoid mutating a program's state whenever
possible. However, for now, we're going to focus on the fundamentals of working
with `Array`s. Remember our workflow:

1. Run `learn test`.
2. Read the errors; vocalize what they're asking you to do.
3. Write code; repeat steps 1 and 2 often until a test passes.
4. Repeat as needed for further tests. `learn test` will save your work and mark
   your assignment complete in Canvas once all the tests are passing.

First, we're going to create four arrays of pets. Define 4 `const` called:
`append`, `prepend`, `removeLast` and `removeFirst`, and set all to an initial
value of `["Milo", "Otis", "Garfield"]`. These are the `array`s that we'll work
with for each exercise.

> **NOTE**: "Append" means "add to the end" and "prepend" means "add to the
> beginning."

## Practice Manipulating Arrays

1. Append the pet "Odie" to the end of `append`.
2. Prepend the pet "Odie" to the beginning of `prepend`.
3. Remove the _last_ pet from `removeLast`.
4. Remove the _first_ pet from `removeFirst`.

## Conclusion

We put our array knowledge into practice by writing and manipulating arrays.
We also covered the concept of mutating state.
